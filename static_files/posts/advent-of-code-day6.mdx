Day 6. A problem where optimization matters.

## Reading the data

Today's problem was a single string of comma delimited numbers.

```typescript
import { readLines } from './deps.ts'

async function parseLine(): Promise<number[]> {
  let result: number[] = []
  const file = await Deno.open('aoc2021/day6-data.txt')

  for await (const line of readLines(file)) {
    result = line.split(',').map((ch) => parseInt(ch) ?? -1)
    break
  }

  return result
}
```

## Part 1

The question asks us to count the final length of the array after 80 days given the following rules

Each number is a timer that goes down to 0. When you try to decrement a 0 value, it instead becomes a 6
and that an 8 is appended to the array of numbers you're iterating over.

Given this, we are asked to find the length of the array after 80 days.

This problem is quite tricky at first, but we should realize that all we're doing is counting up
the number of items at each time state. There are 9 time states that range from 0 to 8.

Given this array, we tabulate the frequency our original state.

Then we decrement each state by shifting over the count at state `i` over to state `i-1`.

However, we want to make sure that if state `0` contains a non-zero frequency, that we
add that frequency to state `6` and that we update state `8` with the frequency count from state `0`.

```typescript
async function countFishes(days: number) {
  const fishes = await parseLine()
  const state: number[] = new Array(9).fill(0)

  fishes.forEach((fish) => {
    state[fish] += 1
  })

  for (let i = 1; i <= days; i++) {
    const toShift = state[0]

    for (let j = 1; j < 9; j++) {
      state[j - 1] = state[j]
    }

    state[8] = toShift

    if (toShift > 0) {
      state[6] += toShift
    }
  }

  console.log(state.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num))
}

countFishes(80)
```

## Part 2

Luckily there isn't much to be done with this part other than changing the input value.

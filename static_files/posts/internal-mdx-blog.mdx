title: Creating an internal blog with MDX

I added a blog feature to my personal site where I render MDX files.

Here is an example of a code block.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
  const doStuff = () => {
    console.log('doing stuff')
  }
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

For the implementation, check out the repository **[here](https://github.com/ja153903/jabbariao_dotcom)**

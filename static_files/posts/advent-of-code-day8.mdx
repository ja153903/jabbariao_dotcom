Day 8.

## Reading in the data

We're given 10 unique signals and 4 output codes. These two sets of data are separated by a pipe character.

Given this input, I decided to create the following interface:

```typescript
interface Signal {
  patterns: string[]
  codes: string[]
}
```

Given this interface, we can then parse the file as follows:

```typescript
import { readLines } from './deps.ts'

async function parseFile(): Promise<Signal[]> {
  let results: Signal[] = []

  const file = await Deno.open('aoc2021/day8-data.txt')

  for await (const line of readLines(file)) {
    let [patterns, codes] = line.split(' | ')
    results.push({
      patterns: patterns.trim().split(' '),
      codes: codes.trim().split(' '),
    })
  }

  return results
}
```

## Part 1

For part 1, we're asked to parse the number of time we can decode the numbers 1, 4, 7, or 8.

The reason these numbers are significant is that these numbers have a unique number of characters that make up
the segment representation as shown [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8).

```typescript
const signals = await parseFile()

const answer = signals.reduce(
  (acc, { codes }) =>
    codes.reduce((acc, code): number => {
      const value: number = definiteValuesMap.get(code.length) ?? -1
      return value !== -1 ? 1 + acc : acc
    }, 0) + acc,
  0
)

console.log(answer)
```

## Part 2

For part 2, we're asked to decode each number in the output codes by deducing each number in the signal given.

This is honestly quite a difficult question to explain. My understanding of this question is that for any pattern
that we're given, we're supposed to figure out which number from 0 to 9 it evaluates into.

The way we can do that is by taking advantage of the signals that evaluate into 1, 4, 7, and 8.

These 4 signals will give us the characters necessary to infer the rest of the numbers.

From these 4 signals, we want to get the intersection of all 4 signals as well as the characters that only appear once across
all 4 signals. These two sets of characters become vital in deducing which values form a certain shape.

```typescript
let result = 0

function intersection(a: string, b: string): string {
  const setA = new Set([...a])
  const setB = new Set([...b])

  return [...setA].filter((ch) => setB.has(ch)).join('')
}

function findIntersectionOfWords(words: string[]): string {
  return words.reduce((acc, word) => intersection(acc, word))
}

function getUniqueCharacter(words: string[]): string[] {
  const counter = new Map<string, number>()

  for (const word of words) {
    for (const ch of word) {
      const currentCount = counter.get(ch) ?? 0
      counter.set(ch, currentCount + 1)
    }
  }

  return [...counter.entries()]
    .filter(([_key, value]) => value === 1)
    .map(([key, _value]) => key)
}

for (const { patterns, codes } of signals) {
  const definiteValues = patterns.filter((pattern) =>
    [2, 3, 4, 7].includes(pattern.length)
  )
  const [commonA, commonB] = findIntersectionOfWords(definiteValues)
  const [uniqueA, uniqueB] = getUniqueCharacter(definiteValues)

  let subresult = 0

  for (const code of codes) {
    const value: number = definiteValuesMap.get(code.length) ?? -1

    subresult *= 10

    if (value !== -1) {
      subresult += value
    } else {
      if (code.length === 5) {
        if (code.includes(commonA) && code.includes(commonB)) {
          subresult += 3
        } else {
          if (code.includes(uniqueA) && code.includes(uniqueB)) {
            subresult += 2
          } else {
            subresult += 5
          }
        }
      } else if (code.length === 6) {
        if (code.includes(commonA) && code.includes(commonB)) {
          if (!code.includes(uniqueA) || !code.includes(uniqueB)) {
            subresult += 9
          }
        } else {
          subresult += 6
        }
      }
    }
  }

  result += subresult
}

console.log(result)
```

When I figure out a more eloquent way to explain this solution I'll update this.

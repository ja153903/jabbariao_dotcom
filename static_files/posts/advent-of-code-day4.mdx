Day 4.

Today's problem was definitely simpler to implement compared to yesterday's problem.

## Reading the data

For this problem, we have two different sets of data in one input file.

The first line contains comma-delimited bingo numbers.

Then we have chunks of `5x5` matrices that serve as a person's bingo board.

Here's how I parsed this file:

```typescript
import { readLines } from 'https://deno.land/std/io/buffer.ts'

async function parseFile(): Promise<{
  bingoNumbers: number[]
  bingoBoardRows: number[][]
}> {
  let bingoNumbers: number[] = []
  const bingoBoardRows: number[][] = []

  const file = await Deno.open('aoc2021/day4-data.txt')

  for await (const line of readLines(file)) {
    if (line.includes(',')) {
      const numbersAsStr: string[] = line.split(',')
      bingoNumbers = numbersAsStr.map((num) => parseInt(num) ?? 0)
    } else if (line.length > 0) {
      const rowAsStr: string[] = line.trim().split(' ')
      const rowAsNum: number[] = rowAsStr
        .map((num) => parseInt(num) ?? 0)
        .filter((num) => !Number.isNaN(num))

      bingoBoardRows.push(rowAsNum)
    }
  }

  return {
    bingoNumbers,
    bingoBoardRows,
  }
}
```

Note that I decided not to stitch the bingo board rows together here.

I wrote a function later on that does this:

```typescript
function convertBingoBoardRowsIntoMatrices(
  rows: number[][],
  size: number
): number[][][] {
  const result: number[][][] = []

  let subresult: number[][] = []
  let count = 0

  for (const row of rows) {
    subresult.push(row)
    count += 1

    if (count % size === 0) {
      count = 0
      result.push(subresult)
      subresult = []
    }
  }

  return result
}
```

## Part 1

The first problem asks us to simulate this game of Bingo.

We go through each possible number that they can call and mark down these numbers on boards that contain this number.

Once we have a board that achieves Bingo, we then sum up the remaining elements from the board that were not chosen for Bingo
and then multiply that sum by the last number chosen for Bingo.

Before solving this, I thought it would be pretty convenient to have a function that can determine whether the board achieves bingo.

So I wrote the following:

```typescript
function doesBoardHaveWinner(board: number[][]): boolean {
  for (const row of board) {
    let isAllNegative = true
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      if (row[i] !== -1) {
        isAllNegative = false
        break
      }
    }

    if (isAllNegative) {
      return true
    }
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < board[0].length; i++) {
    let isAllNegative = true
    for (let j = 0; j < board.length; j++) {
      if (board[j][i] !== -1) {
        isAllNegative = false
        break
      }
    }

    if (isAllNegative) {
      return true
    }
  }

  return false
}
```

In addition to this, we should also have a function that allows us to mark the bingo numbers on the boards. We can use `-1` for this.

Here's that implementation:

```typescript
function markBoard(board: number[][], bingoNumber: number): boolean {
  for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < board[i].length; j++) {
      if (board[i][j] === bingoNumber) {
        board[i][j] = -1
      }
    }
  }

  return doesBoardHaveWinner(board)
}
```

Lastly, given that we're also supposed to sum up the leftover numbers after we've marked all the bingo numbers.

We should have a function for that as well:

```typescript
function sumUpNonNegativeElements(board: number[][]): number {
  let sum = 0

  for (const row of board) {
    for (const col of row) {
      if (col > 0) {
        sum += col
      }
    }
  }

  return sum
}
```

As for the task at hand, we have the following:

```typescript
const { bingoNumbers, bingoBoardRows } = await parseFile()
const bingoBoards = convertBingoBoardRowsIntoMatrices(bingoBoardRows, 5)

// Part 1
for (const number of bingoNumbers) {
  let foundWinner = false
  for (const board of bingoBoards) {
    const doesBoardHaveWinner = markBoard(board, number)
    if (doesBoardHaveWinner) {
      foundWinner = true
      const sum = sumUpNonNegativeElements(board)
      console.log(sum * number)
      break
    }
  }

  if (foundWinner) {
    break
  }
}
```

## Part 2

Part 2 is similar in structure but instead of finding the first winning board, we should find the last winning board.

```typescript
const winners = new Set<number>()

for (const number of bingoNumbers) {
  let skippedAll = true
  for (let i = 0; i < bingoBoards.length; i++) {
    if (winners.has(i)) {
      continue
    }

    skippedAll = false

    const doesBoardHaveWinner = markBoard(bingoBoards[i], number)
    if (doesBoardHaveWinner) {
      winners.add(i)
    }

    if (doesBoardHaveWinner && winners.size === bingoBoards.length) {
      const sum = sumUpNonNegativeElements(bingoBoards[i])
      console.log(sum * number)
    }
  }

  if (skippedAll) {
    break
  }
}
```

That's it for day 4!

Another year, another Advent of Code.

This year I wanted to solve the problems using TypeScript and Deno.

So I'll be posting my solutions here.

## Reading the Data

I have yet to play with Deno's file system API. So this was a nice way of starting things.

Problem 1 wants us to read a file containing numbers. So first thing's first: copy and paste the data into a text file.

Once we have that, we should create some utility function to read the data into an array.

After a little googling, here we are:

```typescript
import { readLines } from 'https://deno.land/std/io/buffer.ts'

async function parseFileToArray(): Promise<number[]> {
  const result: number[] = []

  const file = await Deno.open('aoc2021/day1-data.txt')

  for await (const line of readLines(file)) {
    const num = parseInt(line)
    result.push(num)
  }

  return result
}
```

## Part 1

The first task is to count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement.

This is quite a simple problem. We just have to check the previous number to see if it's less than the current
number.

```typescript
function getNumIncreased(numbers: number[]): number {
  let numIncreased = 0

  for (let i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    if (numbers[i] > numbers[i - 1]) {
      numIncreased++
    }
  }

  return numIncreased
}

const numbers = await parseFileToArray()

let numIncreased = getNumIncreased(numbers)

console.log(numIncreased)
```

Starting off strong. Let's go on the next part

## Part 2

The second tasks is to count the number of times the sum of measurements in this sliding window increases from the previous sum.
This sliding window has a size of 3.

So we should first create another array with the numbers condensed into its sliding window sums.

`Ex: [10, 20, 30, 40] => [60, 90]`

Then once we have that new array, we can reuse the `getNumIncreased` function we created in part 1.

```typescript
const slidingWindowSums: number[] = []
let runningSum = 0

for (let i = 0; i <= numbers.length; i++) {
  if (i === numbers.length) {
    slidingWindowSums.push(runningSum)
    break
  } else if (i > 2) {
    slidingWindowSums.push(runningSum)
    runningSum -= numbers[i - 3]
  }

  runningSum += numbers[i]
}

numIncreased = getNumIncreased(slidingWindowSums)

console.log(numIncreased)
```

Nice that's a wrap for day 1.

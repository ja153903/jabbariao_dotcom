title: Prefer Creating New Components to Rendering Them in Sub-functions

## So what am I even talking about in my title?

Early on in my career writing React, I came across this pattern of writing components.

```javascript
function Parent() {
  const renderChildren = () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Rendering something here</h2>
      </div>
    )
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Rendering the parent component</h1>
      {renderChildren()}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now theoretically, there is nothing wrong with this. It's completely valid React to write,
but I believe we can also consider this an anti-pattern in React.

In React, we want to create atomic and re-usable components so having a render sub-function
goes against that principle.

## So what should we do?

```javascript
function Children() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Rendering something here</h2>
    </div>
  )
}

function Parent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Rendering the parent component</h1>
      <Children />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The ideal pattern is **to create another component with the content in the render sub-function**.

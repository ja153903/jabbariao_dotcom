Day 2. Let's see what they have for us.

## Reading the Data

Each line gives us a space delimited string. The first part is the `direction` and the second part is how many `units` we move in that direction.

Let's create a utility function to parse today's dataset.

```typescript
import { readLines } from 'https://deno.land/std/io/buffer.ts'

interface Moves {
  direction: string
  unit: number
}

async function parseFile(): Promise<Moves[]> {
  const result: Moves[] = []

  const file = await Deno.open('aoc2021/day2-data.txt')

  for await (const line of readLines(file)) {
    const [direction, unit] = line.split(' ')

    result.push({
      direction,
      unit: parseInt(unit),
    })
  }

  return result
}
```

## Part 1

Here are some details they've given us:

`forward X` increases the horizontal position by `X` units.

`down X` increases the depth by `X` units.

`up X` decreases the depth by `X` units.

They want us to find the product of the `forward` position and the `depth`.

```typescript
const moves = await parseFile()

let forward = 0,
  depth = 0

for (const { direction, unit } of moves) {
  switch (direction) {
    case 'forward':
      forward += unit
      break
    case 'up':
      depth -= unit
      break
    case 'down':
      depth += unit
      break
  }
}

console.log(forward * depth)
```

## Part 2

Part 2 makes the following changes:

In addition to horizontal position and depth, you'll also need to track a third value, aim, which also starts at 0. The commands also mean something entirely different than you first thought:

`down X` increases the aim by `X` units.

`up X` decreases the aim by `X` units.

`forward X` increases the horizontal position by `X` units.

`forward X` does two things: increases your horizontal position by X units and increases your depth by your aim multiplied by X.

They want us to again find the product of the `forward` position and the `depth`

```typescript
let aim = 0
;(forward = 0), (depth = 0)

for (const { direction, unit } of moves) {
  switch (direction) {
    case 'forward':
      forward += unit
      depth += aim * unit
      break
    case 'up':
      aim -= unit
      break
    case 'down':
      aim += unit
      break
  }
}

console.log(forward * depth)
```

This was a surprisingly easier problem for day 2.

Day 7.

## Reading in the data

Today we're given a single line of integers that are comma-delimited.

According to the prompt, these numbers represent the horizontal position of a crab.

```typescript
import { readLines } from './deps.ts'

async function parseFile(): Promise<number[]> {
  let result: number[] = []

  const file = await Deno.open('aoc2021/day7-data.txt')

  for await (const line of readLines(file)) {
    result = line.split(',').map((ch) => parseInt(ch) ?? -1)
  }

  return result
}
```

## Part 1

Part 1 asks us to determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible.

Given that number, we are supposed to find out how much fuel must they spend to align to that position.

```typescript
const crabs: number[] = await parseFile()

const maxPos = Math.max(...crabs)
const minPos = Math.min(...crabs)

let minFuel = Number.MAX_VALUE
for (let i = minPos; i <= maxPos; i++) {
  const curFuel = crabs
    .map((crab) => Math.abs(i - crab))
    .reduce((acc, num) => acc + num)

  minFuel = Math.min(minFuel, curFuel)
}

console.log(minFuel)
```

Having `maxPos` and `minPos` is just a way of defining the proper range of integers we need to consider.

## Part 2

Part 2 asks us to compute the same except that we're augmenting the way steps are calculated.

We are told the following: Instead, each change of 1 step in horizontal position costs 1 more unit of fuel
than the last: the first step costs 1, the second step costs 2, the third step costs 3, and so on.

To accommodate this new piece of code, we should create a function that computes the sum of natural numbers up to `n`.

```typescript
function getSumUpToN(n: number): number {
  return (n * (n + 1)) / 2
}
```

Then we can compute the minimum fuel needed:

```typescript
minFuel = Number.MAX_VALUE
for (let i = minPos; i <= maxPos; i++) {
  const curFuel = crabs
    .map((crab) => {
      const diff = Math.abs(i - crab)
      return getSumUpToN(diff)
    })
    .reduce((acc, num) => acc + num)

  minFuel = Math.min(minFuel, curFuel)
}

console.log(minFuel)
```

That's it for day 7.

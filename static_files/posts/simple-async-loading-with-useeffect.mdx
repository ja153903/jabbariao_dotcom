## Something I've noticed

When interviewing candidates, we like doing a pair programming problem that involves
loading data from some mock data source into local React state.

For some reason, this tends to stump a number of candidates as they don't necessarily
know where the appropriate place to load the data is.

## Common approach I've seen

One candidate decided to do the following:

```javascript
function App() {
  const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState([])

  fetchTransactions().then(({ data }) => {
    setTransactions(data)
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {transactions.map((transaction, index) => (
          <li key={transaction.id}>{transaction.id}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This approach seems like an intuitive way to do this, but there are
some issues with this approach.

One such issue revolves around the cleanup of the component. Suppose that the async call
takes a long time, and during the time that the call is made, the component unmounts.

Then once the call is finally finished, we try to set state with the data.

This will result in a potential memory leak since React cannot update state
on an unmounted component.

Another fundamental issue is that in React documentation it is stated that

`All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props`

This means that we should not run side-effects like directly in the function (since
the function itself acts as the render function)

## Ideal approach

The ideal approach we want to see from candidates is to create use the `React.useEffect` hook.

Why do we want to use this hook? We want to use the `React.useEffect` hook because it allows us
to manage side-effects in functional components which is exactly what we needed in the previous example.

So a slightly improved version of the code above would look something like:

```javascript
function App() {
  const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState([])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetchTransactions().then(({ data }) => {
      setTransactions(data)
    })
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {transactions.map((transaction, index) => (
          <li key={transaction.id}>{transaction.id}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We can iterate on this a bit more and take advantage of `async/await` syntax

```javascript
function App() {
  const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState([])

  async function fetchTransactionsFromApi() {
    let response;

    try {
      response = await fetchTransactions()
    } except {
      // something bad happened
    }

    if (response) {
      const { data } = response
      setTransactions(data)
    }
  }

  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetchTransactionsFromApi()
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {transactions.map((transaction, index) => (
          <li key={transaction.id}>{transaction.id}</li>
        ))
        }
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Also note that the empty dependency array in the `React.useEffect` function denotes that we want this hook to be run when the component is mounted

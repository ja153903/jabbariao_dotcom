Day 3. I spoke too soon when I made a comment about the difficulty of the problem.

Today's problem was definitely more difficult compared to the previous day.

## Reading the data

We are given binary data with which we need to parse bits by position. So we should keep those are strings until
we need to convert them.

```typescript
import { readLines } from 'https://deno.land/std/io/buffer.ts'

async function parseFile(): Promise<string[]> {
  const result: string[] = []

  const file = await Deno.open('aoc2021/day3-data.txt')

  for await (const line of readLines(file)) {
    result.push(line)
  }

  return result
}
```

## Part 1

The first part requires us to compute these two statistics called `gamma rate` and `epsilon rate`.

These two statistics were computed based on the most frequent and least frequent bit at that position.

`gamma rate` is computed based on the most frequent bit at that position while `epsilon rate` is based on the least frequent bit.
This means that for index 0, we would have to go through each input and count the frequency for each `1` or `0` that we come across.

We would then take the bits we construct from their instruction and multiply them to produce some number (not in binary).

```typescript
function convertBinaryToNumber(binary: string[]): number {
  let result = 0
  let power = 0
  while (binary.length > 0) {
    result += parseInt(binary.pop() ?? '0') * Math.pow(2, power)
    power += 1
  }

  return result
}

interface CommonBits {
  mostCommonBits: string[]
  leastCommonBits: string[]
}

function getMostAndLeastCommonBits(binaryNums: string[]): CommonBits {
  const mostCommonBits = []
  const leastCommonBits = []

  for (let i = 0; i < binaryNums[0].length; i++) {
    let zeros = 0
    let ones = 0

    for (const binaryNum of binaryNums) {
      if (binaryNum[i] === '1') {
        ones += 1
      } else {
        zeros += 1
      }
    }

    if (ones >= zeros) {
      mostCommonBits.push('1')
      leastCommonBits.push('0')
    } else {
      mostCommonBits.push('0')
      leastCommonBits.push('1')
    }
  }

  return {
    mostCommonBits,
    leastCommonBits,
  }
}

const binaryNums = await parseFile()

const { mostCommonBits, leastCommonBits } =
  getMostAndLeastCommonBits(binaryNums)

const gamma = convertBinaryToNumber(mostCommonBits)
const epsilon = convertBinaryToNumber(leastCommonBits)

console.log(gamma * epsilon)
```

## Part 2

This part was a bit of headache to read through, but once you get through it, it's similar to the previous problem.

Part 2 asks us to compute two new statistics `oxygen generator rating` and `CO2 generator rating`.

To find these statistics, we need to filter the binary numbers we have based on two `bit criteria` they provide.

The bit criteria for `oxygen generator rating` is: determine the most common value (0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 1 in the position being considered.

The bit criteria for `CO2 generator rating` is: determine the least common value (0 or 1) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If 0 and 1 are equally common, keep values with a 0 in the position being considered.

We would need to filter two copies of the input data we were given based on these bit criteria until there is only 1 item left in the array.
The remaining binary data would then be multiplied together to find our answer.

```typescript
let oxygenGeneratorRating = [...binaryNums]
let co2GeneratorRating = [...binaryNums]
let currentIndex = 0

while (oxygenGeneratorRating.length > 1) {
  const { mostCommonBits } = getMostAndLeastCommonBits(oxygenGeneratorRating)
  const mostCommonBit = mostCommonBits[currentIndex]

  oxygenGeneratorRating = oxygenGeneratorRating.filter(
    (binaryNum) => binaryNum[currentIndex] === mostCommonBit
  )
  currentIndex += 1
}

currentIndex = 0

while (co2GeneratorRating.length > 1) {
  const { leastCommonBits } = getMostAndLeastCommonBits(co2GeneratorRating)

  const leastCommonBit = leastCommonBits[currentIndex]

  co2GeneratorRating = co2GeneratorRating.filter(
    (binaryNum) => binaryNum[currentIndex] === leastCommonBit
  )

  currentIndex += 1
}

const oxygenGeneratorRatingCandidate = oxygenGeneratorRating?.[0] ?? ''
const co2GeneratorRatingCandidate = co2GeneratorRating?.[0] ?? ''

const oxygen = convertBinaryToNumber([...oxygenGeneratorRatingCandidate])
const co2 = convertBinaryToNumber([...co2GeneratorRatingCandidate])

console.log(oxygen * co2)
```

It definitely took some time to digest the information they gave. But that's a wrap for day 3.
